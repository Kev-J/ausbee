About this code:
This code is provided by Eirbot team to show how FreeRTOS and STM libraries can
be used with the F4Discovery board.

About STM32F4 programmer:
You may need Texane/st-link tool to flash the microcontroller. This tool is available on git:
https://github.com/texane/stlink
Refer to the corresponding README to install it. Do not forget to update your PATH environment 
variable!

Steps:
To try this code, do the following steps:
1 - Copy "main.c" and "stm32f4xx_irq.c" files from Software/Examples/stm32f4discovery
	to Software/Project/src

2 - From Software/ directory, configure the project with the following command:
	make menuconfig

2 - 1 -	In menu "Build option->Programming Interface" select STLink v2
2 - 2 -	In menu "Libraries" select everything except "libausbee"
2 - 3 -	In menu "Operation System" select FreeRTOS
2 - 4 -	In menu "Platform" select STM32F4DISCOVERY

3 -	Quit the configuration menu and build the project with the following command:
	make

4 - Plug your board to your PC with a mini-USB cable

5 - Flash the microcontroller with the following command:
	make program

6 - Press the user button of the board to switch between the two demos:
	one is simply blinking the green LED
	the other uses the MEMS accelerometer to control the four LEDs

Troubleshooting:
Compilation fail: 
	Check configuration with "make menuconfig"

Flash fail:
	Is PATH correctly set?
